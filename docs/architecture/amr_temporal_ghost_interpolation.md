# AMR Temporal Ghost Interpolation

Date: 2026-06-18

## Implemented contract

CHUÍ records coarse patch conserved state at both ends of an open local coarse interval and uses that
history for coarse-to-fine ghosts during local AMR hydro subcycling. The ghost-fill request carries a target
state time, requested ghost-fill time, current source-state time, temporal-history pointer, and explicit
coarse-to-fine temporal enablement. The requested time is the beginning of the current fine hydro update.
That convention is deliberate: the production `HydroCoreSolver` consumes ghost state before the
MUSCL-Hancock reconstruction/predictor path, so this layer must not guess a separate half-step external
boundary time.

Interpolation is performed on conserved state only:

```text
U(t_fill) = (1 - alpha) U_start + alpha U_end
alpha = (t_fill - t_start) / (t_end - t_start)
```

Endpoints are exact. A tiny endpoint tolerance handles floating-point representation only; genuine
extrapolation is rejected. The interpolated conserved state is checked for finite positive density and then
converted through the existing ideal-gas primitive recovery. A non-finite or non-positive recovered state is
a hard error.

## Stable identity and lifecycle

A temporal history record contains patch ID, patch level, geometry fingerprint, gas identity generation,
interval, completion marker, and one record per source patch cell. Per-cell records contain stable
`gas_cell_id`, patch-local cell index, and conserved start/end state. The fill path resolves both stable
identity and patch-local location. It does not use a dense storage row as physical identity.

A history becomes invalid when geometry or identity generation changes. The local implementation blocks
refine/derefine while histories are active. It has no MPI migration/remapping path. Same-level ghosts
require equal source/target time. Fine-to-coarse ghost reads require synchronization time and otherwise
reject with a named temporal-misalignment status.

## Restart

Schema `cosmosim_restart_v18` serializes active histories in
`/state/amr_temporal_boundary_history`. A restart written while a local interval is active must contain a
completed coarse start/end history before remaining fine substeps can resume. The HDF5 test
`integration_restart_equivalence_amr_temporal_ghosts` exercises this exact continuation path.

## Non-claims

The implementation is not distributed temporal ghost exchange, not arbitrary-depth Berger-Colella time
subcycling, and not a temporal interpolation model for remote fine patches. It does not permit history to
survive AMR regridding or patch migration by remapping; it fails safely instead.
